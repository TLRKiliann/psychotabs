# PSYCHOTABS (python3 and tkinter)

This application can help health professionals, particularly in the psychiatric and neurological fields. 
The data contained in this application comes from the Compendium, but also from Lausanne physicians and some interesting sites (all this is indicated in the bibliography).
This application highlights interactions, side effects and much more on psychotropic drugs.

# Types of drugs (psychotropic drugs)

The different psychotropic drugs are grouped by class or family.
E.g.: antipsychotics, anti-epileptics, antidepressants, thymoregulators, sleep inducers, anxiolytics, benzodiazepines.

I decline any responsibility in case of use of this application for a patient. The content is to be used for informational purposes only.

This is my first app I made with python3-tkinter ;)

For launching this app use :
> python3 psychotabs.py

Hoping to be useful !
